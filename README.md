# IdeaSource Server Project
[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-orange.svg)](https://github.com/orangeloops/public-phoenix-server/pulls) [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/orangeloops/public-phoenix-server.svg)](https://github.com/orangeloops/public-phoenix-server/blob/develop/LICENSE)

## What's IdeaSource?

[IdeaSource](https://ideasource.io/) is an open-source platform to gather, manage and organize ideas for creative problem solving. We used it internally as a sandbox to research React Native development front to back.

## Why IdeaSource?

Coming up with good ideas can be hard, especially after a while when echo chambers tend to appear in teams, groupthink takes over and creative solutions are left out of the conversation. We wished to introduce an easy way to share and manage ideas generated by a larger pool of people than those directly tasked with coming up with a solution, providing mechanisms for everyone to vote to sort the proposed ideas. 

## How does it work?

Ideas are gathered around challenges, which can be problems, aspects or topics a group or organization may need to fix or improve. In order to create a challenge you must enter a description, upload an image and set a deadline. Challenges can be either private or public. Private challenges are only available to users registered using the same corporate email domain, while open challenges are open for every user in IdeaSource. Once a challenge is submitted, everyone can start contributing ideas, and votes for ideas already shared.

## Getting Started

Run the following commands in your terminal

```bash
git clone https://github.com/orangeloops/public-phoenix-server.git
cd public-phoenix-server
npm install
npm start:watch
```
[ Optional ] Run `db:seed` to charge the database with initial dummy values

Then open [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/graphql) on your web browser.

### Testing

Run `npm test` for test.
